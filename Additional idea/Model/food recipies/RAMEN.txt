RAMEN

Ingredients:

4 cups chicken or vegetable broth
2 cups water
2 packs of ramen noodles (discard the seasoning packets if you prefer to make your own broth)
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon miso paste (optional)
1 tablespoon sesame oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1-inch piece of ginger, grated
Sliced green onions, for garnish
Sliced boiled eggs, for garnish
Sliced cooked meat or tofu, for garnish (optional)
Sliced vegetables (such as carrots, mushrooms, bok choy), for garnish (optional)
Nori seaweed sheets, torn into small pieces, for garnish (optional)
Instructions:

In a large pot, heat the sesame oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger, and saut√© for about 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

Add the chicken or vegetable broth and water to the pot. If you're not using the seasoning packets from the ramen noodles, you can add soy sauce and miso paste to the broth for extra flavor.

Bring the broth to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.

While the broth is simmering, prepare the ramen noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.

Once the broth is ready, taste and adjust the seasoning as desired. You can add more soy sauce or miso paste for extra flavor.

To assemble the ramen bowls, divide the cooked ramen noodles into serving bowls. Ladle the hot broth over the noodles.

Garnish with sliced green onions, sliced boiled eggs, cooked meat or tofu, sliced vegetables, and torn nori seaweed sheets.
