PIZZA

Ingredients:

For the dough:

2 ¼ teaspoons (1 packet) of active dry yeast
1 teaspoon of sugar
1 cup of warm water (around 110°F/43°C)
2 ½ cups of all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons of olive oil
1 teaspoon of salt
For the sauce:

1 can (14 ounces or 400 grams) of crushed tomatoes
2 cloves of garlic, minced
1 teaspoon of dried basil
1 teaspoon of dried oregano
Salt and pepper to taste
For the toppings:

Shredded mozzarella cheese
Desired toppings such as pepperoni, sliced vegetables, cooked sausage, mushrooms, etc.
Instructions:

Prepare the dough:

In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Stir gently and let it sit for about 5 minutes until the yeast becomes frothy.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.
Stir the mixture with a spoon until a dough starts to form.
Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead it for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.
Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours until it doubles in size.
Prepare the sauce:

In a small saucepan, combine the crushed tomatoes, minced garlic, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper.
Simmer the sauce over low heat for about 15-20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. Adjust the seasoning to your taste.
Preheat the oven:

Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can reach, typically around 475°F (245°C) or higher. If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well.
Roll out the dough:

Once the dough has risen, punch it down and transfer it to a lightly floured surface.
Roll out the dough into your desired pizza shape and thickness. You can make one large pizza or divide the dough to make multiple smaller ones.
Assemble the pizza:

Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza stone, baking sheet, or pizza pan.
Spread a layer of the prepared sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.
Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.
Add your desired toppings on top of the cheese. Be creative and use any combination of toppings you prefer.
Bake the pizza:

Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and melted.
Serve and enjoy:

Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.
Slice the pizza into wedges and serve it hot.
Feel free to garnish with fresh basil, grated Parmesan cheese, or a drizzle of olive oil if desired.
