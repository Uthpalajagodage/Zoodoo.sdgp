OMELETTE

Ingredients:

3 large eggs
2 tablespoons of milk or water
Salt and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon of butter or cooking oil
Optional fillings: Shredded cheese, diced vegetables (such as bell peppers, onions, mushrooms), cooked bacon or ham, fresh herbs (such as parsley or chives)
Instructions:

Beat the eggs: In a bowl, crack the eggs and whisk them together until the yolks and whites are fully combined. Add the milk or water and whisk again until well incorporated. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Prepare the fillings: If using any fillings, prepare them by chopping or shredding them into small pieces. Cook any raw vegetables or meats in advance if necessary.

Heat the skillet: Place a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the butter or oil and let it melt or heat up.

Pour and cook the eggs: Once the butter or oil is hot, pour the beaten eggs into the skillet. Let the eggs cook undisturbed for a few seconds until the edges start to set.

Add the fillings: Sprinkle the desired fillings evenly over one half of the omelette. Be mindful not to overfill, as it may make folding the omelette more challenging.

Fold the omelette: Using a spatula, carefully lift the empty half of the omelette and fold it over the filling side, creating a half-moon shape. Press down gently with the spatula to seal the omelette.

Cook and finish: Reduce the heat to low and continue cooking the folded omelette for another 1-2 minutes, or until the fillings are heated through and the omelette is cooked to your desired level of doneness. If you prefer a slightly runny center, cook it for a shorter time.
