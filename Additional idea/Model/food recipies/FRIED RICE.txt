FRIED RICE

Ingredients:

3 cups of cooked rice (preferably leftover rice, chilled)
2 tablespoons of vegetable oil
1 cup of cooked protein (chicken, shrimp, or tofu), diced or shredded (optional)
1/2 cup of diced vegetables (carrots, peas, bell peppers, onions, etc.)
2 cloves of garlic, minced
2 eggs, lightly beaten
2 tablespoons of soy sauce
1 tablespoon of oyster sauce (optional)
1/2 teaspoon of sesame oil
Salt and pepper to taste
Optional toppings: sliced green onions, chopped cilantro, sesame seeds
Instructions:

Heat the oil: Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat.

Sauté the protein and vegetables: If using cooked protein, sauté it in the hot oil until heated through. If using raw protein, cook it first before adding the vegetables. Add the diced vegetables to the skillet and stir-fry for a few minutes until they are slightly tender. You can add vegetables according to your preference.

Add garlic and eggs: Push the protein and vegetables to one side of the skillet and add the minced garlic to the other side. Cook for about 30 seconds until fragrant, then add the lightly beaten eggs to the skillet. Stir the eggs gently until they are scrambled and cooked through.

Add the rice: Add the cooked rice to the skillet, breaking up any clumps with a spatula. Mix the rice with the protein, vegetables, and eggs until well combined.

Season the fried rice: Drizzle the soy sauce, oyster sauce (if using), and sesame oil over the rice. Toss everything together until the rice is evenly coated with the sauces. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Be careful not to add too much salt if your soy sauce is already salty.

Stir-fry and combine: Stir-fry the fried rice for a few minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together and the rice to heat through. Make sure everything is well combined.

Serve: Remove the skillet from heat and transfer the fried rice to serving plates or bowls. Garnish with sliced green onions, chopped cilantro, and sesame seeds, if desired.
