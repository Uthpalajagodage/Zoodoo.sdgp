BEET SALAD

Ingredients:

3 medium-sized beets
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
1/4 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
Salt and pepper to taste
Mixed salad greens (optional, for serving)
Instructions:

Start by cooking the beets. You can either roast or boil them. To roast, preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Trim off the beet greens, leaving about an inch of the stems intact. Wrap each beet in aluminum foil and place them on a baking sheet. Roast for about 45-60 minutes, or until the beets are tender when pierced with a knife. If boiling, place the trimmed beets in a large pot of boiling water and cook for about 30-40 minutes, or until tender. Once cooked, let the beets cool before handling.

Once the beets are cool enough to handle, peel off the skins using your hands or a knife. The skins should come off easily. Cut the beets into bite-sized cubes or slices and place them in a mixing bowl.

Add the crumbled feta cheese and chopped walnuts (if using) to the bowl with the beets.

In a separate small bowl, whisk together the balsamic vinegar, olive oil, lemon juice, chopped parsley, salt, and pepper until well combined.

Pour the dressing over the beet mixture and gently toss until everything is well coated.
