LASAGNA


Certainly! Here's a classic recipe for lasagna:

Ingredients:

For the meat sauce:

1 pound (450 grams) of ground beef
1 onion, diced
3 cloves of garlic, minced
1 can (14 ounces or 400 grams) of crushed tomatoes
1 can (6 ounces or 170 grams) of tomato paste
1 can (8 ounces or 227 grams) of tomato sauce
2 teaspoons of dried basil
2 teaspoons of dried oregano
1 teaspoon of sugar
Salt and pepper to taste
For the cheese filling:

2 cups (500 grams) of ricotta cheese
1/2 cup (50 grams) of grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup (15 grams) of fresh parsley, chopped
1 large egg
Salt and pepper to taste
Other ingredients:

12 lasagna noodles, cooked according to package instructions
3 cups (300 grams) of shredded mozzarella cheese
Instructions:

Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

Prepare the meat sauce: In a large skillet or saucepan, brown the ground beef over medium heat. Add the diced onion and minced garlic, and cook until the onion is translucent and the beef is fully cooked. Drain any excess fat from the pan.

Add the tomato sauce and seasonings: To the cooked beef, add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, dried basil, dried oregano, sugar, salt, and pepper. Stir well to combine. Let the sauce simmer for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.

Prepare the cheese filling: In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, chopped parsley, egg, salt, and pepper. Mix well until fully combined.

Assemble the lasagna: Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place 4 cooked lasagna noodles on top, slightly overlapping to cover the bottom. Spread half of the cheese filling evenly over the noodles, followed by a layer of meat sauce. Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese on top. Repeat the layers with 4 more noodles, the remaining cheese filling, meat sauce, and mozzarella cheese. Finish with a final layer of 4 lasagna noodles, meat sauce, and mozzarella cheese.

Bake the lasagna: Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, ensuring it is sealed tightly to trap the heat. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes until the cheese is melted, bubbly, and lightly golden.

Let it rest: Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving. This allows the lasagna to set and makes it easier to portion.
