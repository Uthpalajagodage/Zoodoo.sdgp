FROZEN YOGURT

Ingredients:

4 cups (900 grams) of plain yogurt (Greek yogurt works well)
1/2 cup (100 grams) of granulated sugar (adjust to taste)
1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
Optional: Fresh fruit, such as berries or sliced peaches, for flavoring
Instructions:

Prepare the yogurt: In a large bowl, combine the plain yogurt, sugar, and vanilla extract. Stir until the sugar is fully dissolved and the mixture is well combined.

Optional: If you're adding fresh fruit for flavoring, wash and chop the fruit into small pieces. You can add about 1-2 cups of fruit to the yogurt mixture, depending on your preference. Stir the fruit into the yogurt mixture until evenly distributed.

Chill the mixture: Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the mixture for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to meld together and the mixture to cool.

Freeze the yogurt: After chilling, pour the yogurt mixture into an ice cream maker. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for freezing, typically running the machine for about 20-25 minutes or until the mixture reaches a soft-serve consistency.

Transfer to a container: Once the frozen yogurt has reached the desired consistency, transfer it to an airtight container. You can enjoy the frozen yogurt immediately as a soft-serve texture or continue to freeze it for a firmer consistency.

Hardening in the freezer: If you prefer a firmer frozen yogurt, place the container in the freezer for a few hours or until it reaches the desired firmness. Remember to cover the container tightly to prevent freezer burn.
