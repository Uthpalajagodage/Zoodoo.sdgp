PAN CAKES

Ingredients:

1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons granulated sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
1 large egg
2 tablespoons melted butter (plus more for greasing the pan)
Optional: additional ingredients like chocolate chips, blueberries, or sliced bananas
Instructions:

In a mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and melted butter.

Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined.

It's okay if there are a few lumps in the batter.

If desired, you can add in additional ingredients like chocolate chips, blueberries, or sliced bananas at this point and gently fold them into the batter.

Heat a large non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add a small amount of butter to grease the surface.

Scoop about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip the pancake and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown.

Transfer the cooked pancakes to a plate and cover with a towel to keep them warm. Repeat the process with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the pan as needed.

Serve the pancakes with your favorite toppings, such as maple syrup, fresh fruit, whipped cream, or a sprinkle of powdered sugar.
