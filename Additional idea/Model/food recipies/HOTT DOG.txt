HOTT DOG

Ingredients:

4 hot dog buns
4 beef hot dogs
Condiments of your choice (ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, onions, sauerkraut, etc.)
Instructions:

Preheat the grill or stovetop: If using a grill, preheat it to medium-high heat. If using a stovetop, preheat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat.

Grill or cook the hot dogs: Place the hot dogs on the grill or in the skillet. Cook them for about 5-7 minutes, turning occasionally, until they are heated through and have grill marks or are lightly browned.

Warm the buns: If desired, you can lightly toast the hot dog buns by placing them on the grill for a minute or in a toaster. This step is optional, but it adds a nice crunch to the buns.

Assemble the hot dogs: Place each hot dog inside a bun. Add your preferred condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, onions, sauerkraut, or any other toppings of your choice.
