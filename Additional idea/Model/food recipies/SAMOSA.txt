SAMOSA

Ingredients:

For the dough:

2 cups (250 grams) all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon of salt
2 tablespoons of vegetable oil
Water (as needed)
For the filling:

2 medium potatoes, boiled and mashed
1/2 cup (75 grams) green peas, boiled and slightly mashed
1 small onion, finely chopped
2 green chilies, finely chopped (adjust to taste)
1 teaspoon of grated ginger
1 teaspoon of cumin seeds
1 teaspoon of coriander powder
1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder
1/2 teaspoon of garam masala
Salt to taste
2 tablespoons of vegetable oil
Fresh coriander leaves, chopped (optional)
For frying:

Vegetable oil for deep frying
Instructions:

Prepare the dough:

In a mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, salt, and vegetable oil. Mix well until the oil is evenly distributed.
Gradually add water, a little at a time, and knead to form a firm and smooth dough. The dough should not be too soft or too stiff. Cover the dough and set it aside for 15-20 minutes.
Prepare the filling:

Heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a pan over medium heat.
Add the cumin seeds and allow them to splutter.
Add the chopped onions, grated ginger, and green chilies. Saut√© until the onions turn translucent.
Add the coriander powder, turmeric powder, and garam masala. Stir and cook for a minute.
Add the boiled and mashed potatoes, mashed peas, and salt. Mix well to combine all the ingredients.
Cook the mixture for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and let the filling cool. Add chopped fresh coriander leaves if desired.
Shape and fill the samosas:

Divide the dough into small lemon-sized balls.
Take one ball and roll it out into a thin circle on a lightly floured surface.
Cut the circle in half. Take one half and fold it into a cone shape, overlapping the edges and sealing them with a little water.
Fill the cone with 1-2 tablespoons of the prepared filling, ensuring not to overstuff it.
Apply a little water on the open edges of the cone and press to seal the samosa. Repeat the process with the remaining dough and filling.
Fry the samosas:

Heat vegetable oil in a deep pan or kadai for frying over medium heat.
Once the oil is hot, gently slide a few samosas into the oil, taking care not to overcrowd the pan.
Fry the samosas until they turn golden brown and crispy on all sides. This usually takes about 8-10 minutes.
Remove the fried samosas from the oil using a slotted spoon and drain excess oil on a paper towel.
Serve and enjoy:

Serve the samosas hot with chutney, such as mint chutney or tamarind chutney, or tomato ketchup.
Samosas are best enjoyed fresh, but they can be stored in an airtight container for a day or two and reheated in an oven or toaster oven before serving.
