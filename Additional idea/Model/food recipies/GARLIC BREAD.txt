GARLIC BREAD

Ingredients:

1 French baguette or Italian bread loaf
1/2 cup (113 grams) of unsalted butter, softened
4 cloves of garlic, minced
2 tablespoons of fresh parsley, finely chopped (optional)
1/4 teaspoon of salt
1/4 teaspoon of black pepper
Optional: Shredded mozzarella cheese
Instructions:

Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

Prepare the garlic butter: In a small bowl, mix together the softened butter, minced garlic, fresh parsley (if using), salt, and black pepper. Stir until well combined.

Slice the bread: Take the French baguette or Italian bread loaf and slice it lengthwise, splitting it in half.

Spread the garlic butter: Using a butter knife, spread the garlic butter mixture evenly on the cut sides of the bread.

Optional: If you prefer cheesy garlic bread, sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese on top of the garlic butter.

Reassemble the bread: Place the two halves of the bread back together, forming a loaf shape.

Wrap in foil: Wrap the loaf in aluminum foil, ensuring it is sealed tightly.

Bake in the oven: Place the foil-wrapped loaf on a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until the bread is heated through and the butter is melted.

Optional: For a crispier texture, open the foil during the last 5 minutes of baking and continue baking without the foil.
