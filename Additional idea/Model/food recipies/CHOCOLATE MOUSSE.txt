CHOCOLATE MOUSSE

Ingredients:

8 ounces (225 grams) of high-quality dark chocolate, chopped
4 large eggs, separated
1/4 cup (50 grams) of granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract
Pinch of salt
1 cup (240 milliliters) of heavy cream
Optional: whipped cream and chocolate shavings for garnish
Instructions:

Melt the chocolate: Place the chopped chocolate in a heatproof bowl and set it over a pan of simmering water. Stir the chocolate until it melts completely and becomes smooth. Remove the bowl from the heat and let it cool slightly.

Beat the egg yolks: In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks with half of the sugar until they become pale and creamy. This can be done using an electric mixer or by hand with a whisk.

Incorporate the melted chocolate: Gradually pour the melted chocolate into the beaten egg yolks while continuously whisking. Stir until well combined and smooth.

Whip the egg whites: In another clean bowl, beat the egg whites and salt until soft peaks form. Gradually add the remaining sugar while continuing to beat the egg whites until they form stiff peaks.

Fold in the egg whites: Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the chocolate mixture using a spatula. Make sure to do this slowly and carefully to maintain the light and airy texture.

Whip the cream: In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until it reaches a soft peak consistency.

Combine the whipped cream: Fold the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture, again using a gentle folding motion until everything is well combined.

Chill and set: Transfer the chocolate mousse mixture into individual serving glasses or a large serving bowl. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until set.
