APPLE PIE

Ingredients:

2 pre-made pie crusts (store-bought or homemade)
6 cups of peeled, cored, and sliced apples (about 6-8 medium-sized apples)
3/4 cup granulated sugar
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)
1 tablespoon granulated sugar (for sprinkling)
Instructions:

Preheat your oven to 425째F (220째C).

Roll out one of the pie crusts and fit it into a 9-inch pie dish. Set aside the other crust for the top.

In a large bowl, combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and lemon juice. Toss the mixture until the apples are evenly coated.

Pour the apple mixture into the prepared pie crust, making sure to distribute the filling evenly. Dot the top with the small pieces of butter.

Roll out the second pie crust and place it over the filling. You can create a lattice design or simply lay it over the top and cut slits to allow steam to escape. Trim any excess crust and crimp the edges to seal the pie.

Brush the top crust with the beaten egg, and sprinkle the tablespoon of granulated sugar over it for a golden finish.

Place the pie on a baking sheet to catch any drips, and bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.

After 15 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 375째F (190째C) and continue baking for an additional 40-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. If the edges of the crust start to brown too quickly, you can cover them with aluminum foil.

Once the pie is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for at least 2 hours before serving. This will allow the filling to set.

Serve the apple pie warm or at room temperature, and you can enjoy it as is or with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.
