CARROT CAKE

Ingredients:

For the cake:

2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups granulated sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 cup vegetable oil
4 large eggs
2 cups grated carrots
1/2 cup crushed pineapple, drained
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
For the cream cheese frosting:

8 oz (225g) cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
4 cups powdered sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Optional garnish:

Additional chopped walnuts or grated carrots
Instructions:

Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking pan or two 9-inch round cake pans.

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg.

Add the vegetable oil and eggs to the dry ingredients, and mix until well combined.

Stir in the grated carrots, crushed pineapple, chopped walnuts (if using), and vanilla extract. Mix until the ingredients are evenly distributed.

Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan(s) and smooth the top with a spatula.

Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes for a 9x13-inch pan or 25-30 minutes for round pans, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

Remove the cake(s) from the oven and let them cool in the pan(s) for about 10 minutes. Then transfer the cake(s) to a wire rack to cool completely.

While the cake is cooling, prepare the cream cheese frosting. In a mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese and butter together until creamy and smooth.

Gradually add the powdered sugar, one cup at a time, while continuing to beat the mixture. Add the vanilla extract and beat until the frosting is light and fluffy.

Once the cake has cooled completely, spread the cream cheese frosting evenly over the top and sides of the cake.

If desired, garnish the cake with additional chopped walnuts or grated carrots.
