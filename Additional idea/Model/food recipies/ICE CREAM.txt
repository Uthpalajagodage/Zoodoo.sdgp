ICE CREAM

Ingredients:

2 cups heavy cream
1 cup whole milk
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
Instructions:

In a mixing bowl, combine the heavy cream and whole milk.

Gradually add the granulated sugar to the cream and milk mixture, stirring until the sugar is completely dissolved.

Stir in the vanilla extract and mix well.
Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker.

Follow the manufacturer's instructions for your specific ice cream maker. This typically involves churning the mixture for about 20-30 minutes or until it reaches a soft-serve consistency.

If you prefer a firmer texture, transfer the ice cream to an airtight container and place it in the freezer for a few hours or until it reaches the desired consistency.

Serve the ice cream in bowls or cones, and feel free to add your favorite toppings or sauces.
