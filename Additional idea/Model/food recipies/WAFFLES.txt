WAFFLES

Ingredients:

2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons granulated sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 3/4 cups milk
1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Instructions:

Preheat your waffle iron according to the manufacturer's instructions.

In a mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, melted butter, eggs, and vanilla extract.

Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. 
It's okay if there are a few lumps in the batter.
Lightly grease the preheated waffle iron with non-stick cooking spray or a small amount of melted butter.

Spoon the batter onto the center of the waffle iron, spreading it evenly. 
The amount of batter will depend on the size of your waffle iron.
Close the lid of the waffle iron and cook according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically 3-5 minutes or until the waffles are golden brown and crisp.

Carefully remove the waffles from the iron and place them on a wire rack to cool slightly. Avoid stacking them to prevent them from becoming soggy.

Repeat the process with the remaining batter until all the waffles are cooked.

Serve the waffles warm with your favorite toppings, such as maple syrup, fresh fruit, whipped cream, or a sprinkle of powdered sugar.
