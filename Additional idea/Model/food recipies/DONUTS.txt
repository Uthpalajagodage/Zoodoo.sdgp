DONUTS

Ingredients:

For the donuts:

2 3/4 cups (345 grams) of all-purpose flour
1/4 cup (50 grams) of granulated sugar
2 1/4 teaspoons of active dry yeast
1/2 teaspoon of salt
1/2 cup (120 milliliters) of milk
1/4 cup (56 grams) of unsalted butter, melted
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
Vegetable oil, for frying
For the glaze:

2 cups (250 grams) of powdered sugar
1/4 cup (60 milliliters) of milk
1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
Food coloring or sprinkles (optional)
Instructions:

Proof the yeast: In a small bowl, combine the yeast and 1 teaspoon of sugar with warm milk. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until the mixture becomes frothy.

Mix the dry ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, remaining sugar, and salt.

Combine the wet ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted butter, eggs, and vanilla extract. Add the yeast mixture and whisk again.

Make the dough: Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.

Let the dough rise: Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 to 1.5 hours, or until it doubles in size.

Roll out and cut the donuts: After the dough has risen, punch it down and roll it out on a floured surface to about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) thickness. Use a donut cutter or a round biscuit cutter to cut out donut shapes. If you don't have a cutter, you can use a glass for the outer shape and a smaller one or a bottle cap for the inner circle.

Let the donuts rise again: Place the cut-out donuts onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Cover them with a clean kitchen towel and let them rise for another 30 minutes.

Heat the oil: In a deep pot or a deep fryer, heat vegetable oil to about 350°F (175°C).

Fry the donuts: Carefully add a few donuts to the hot oil, being careful not to overcrowd the pot. Fry for about 2-3 minutes per side until golden brown. Use a slotted spoon or tongs to transfer the fried donuts to a paper towel-lined plate to remove excess oil. Repeat the process until all the donuts are fried.

Prepare the glaze: In a bowl, whisk together powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract until smooth. If desired, add food coloring to the glaze for different colors. You can also dip the glazed donuts into sprinkles while the glaze is still wet.

Glaze the donuts: Dip each donut into the glaze, making sure to coat both sides. Place the glazed donuts on a wire rack to allow any excess glaze to drip off.
